Mini Challenge 9 - Restaurant Picker Endpoint

Web API project that will give the user 3 options to choose from. In my case I chose asian food, fast food, and beverages as my 3 options. There is an instructions page at /minich9/ But by entering ASIAN, FAST, or DRINKS the user will get a randomized restaurant/business sent back to them. I also included error messages for when anything else is entered it will prompt them to enter it in correctly and I also provided links that they can click as well.

# Directions:
1. Open the file in visual studio code.
2. Run the debug either by clicking on the "run and debug" icon on the left side and then the green play button, or by using the F5 command.
3. Next you want to go to your debug console located on the bottom by your terminal.
4. Then look for the "Now listening on:" and there should be a local host URL that you can copy.
5. Take that URL and you can either paste it into a web browser, or by using an application called Postman, you can hit the plus sign at the top of Postman and paste the URL there.
6. After you paste the localhost URL either into a browser or postman, add /MiniCh9 at the end and press send. For example: https://localhost:7267/MiniCh9 and this will lead you to an instructions page to help guide you through the application! *See end of directions for what the Instructions page will look like.*
7. Next you're going to add /Restaurant to the end of your URL. It should look something like this: https://localhost:7267/minich9/Restaurant/
8. At this point you're almost done! Just add a /option (but with your preferred restaurant option ASIAN, FAST, or DRINKS) at the end of the URL and press send! For example my URL would look like this: https://localhost:7267/minich9/Restaurant/ASIAN. (You can replace ASIAN for the other options as needed).
9. If you're having trouble don't forget to check your local host to make sure you're using the right number and ensure that you ran the debug before attempting to use the URL in your web browser or Postman.

*Directions step 6 - What the instructions page will look like when you enter https://localhost:7267/MiniCh9 into Postman or a web browser*

Welcome to the restaurant picker!

You have 3 options: Asian Food, Fast Food or Beverages.

ASIAN = Asian Food, FAST = Fast Food, and DRINKS = Beverages if you're thirsty!

Enter your choice in the URL after restaurant/

For example: https://localhost:7267/minich9/Restaurant/

**Make sure to use all CAPS or your link won't work**

Or if you're lazy you can use the following links:

https://localhost:7267/minich9/Restaurant/ASIAN

https://localhost:7267/minich9/Restaurant/FAST

https://localhost:7267/minich9/Restaurant/DRINKS
